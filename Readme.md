FFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUU-
========

What is more common: FFFFUUUU, or FFUUUUU, or FFFFFUUU, etc.?

The original comic uses the text
"FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU-", which is to say,
f23u22. Somehow f7u12 got promulgated too. Others are pretty easy to
type. So construct a matrix where the (i,j) element is the search
count of "F" repeated i times concatenated with "U" repeated j times.
